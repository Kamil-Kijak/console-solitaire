# Solitaire - A Card Game  
## 📂 About project:
Project created in vanilla C# programming language ```(game is interface is console)```  
I used ```.NET version 8.0``` to set up my project
## 🎮 Game mechanics:  
- Game has similar mechanics to classic solitaire game  
- You can select difficulty ```(easy where you pick one card and hard where you pick three)```  
- You can undo the moves (maximum 3 moves)  
- Your score after win would be saved to ```application folder``` as leaderboard, which game reads it and shows  
## ⚙️ Run project:

git clone https://github.com/Kamil-Kijak/console-solitaire.git
```

- Is recommended to ```resize console window to correct size``` because game elements can display wrong (after resizing where game is running,  just enter a key to refresh all components)
